Where I am / Where AM I ?
A location tracker

Xamarin / Android (c#) app to send locations to server. Works in background. Continues after app is closed and automaticaly retarts on reboot

Server (Windows asp.net service; c#) displays location points for last 24 hours (blue circles) and earlier (grey)

 'Location Service' folder has android code
 'WebMap' folder has server code
 Ignore the folder 'Location', it's a blank project for future work.


ToDo:
 - notification alerts don't respond
 - storage of locations on device (when no internet available) not yet correct
